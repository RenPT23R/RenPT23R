# Hi, I'm RenPT23

I'm passionate about both gaming and programming, and I primarily code in Python as a hobby. Currently, I'm working on a horror game called Photophobia. In the game, you have a flashlight, but using it is dangerous, as it could risk your life in the dark.
To support this game, I'm building my own game engine and a map editor. The map editor uses a unique format for 3D models called JMAP, which is based on JSON. I'm more comfortable with Python btw.

## My Programming Journey

### 2022 – The Beginning  
I started programming with Swift. It was a solid introduction, and I learned how to work with variables and print values. I created basic functional calculators, though they couldn't take input at the time (no ChatGPT to help back then).

### Early 2023 – Exploring New Areas  
I moved on to explore other languages and concepts, though I can't remember the exact details of what I worked on.

### Mid 2023 – Python & Scratch  
I got into Python and Scratch, spending most of my time with Scratch. I made simple games and programs, learning the fundamentals of coding along the way.

### Later 2023 – A Shift to Scratch  
I shifted focus entirely to Scratch, building games and projects in the visual environment, though Python was still in the back of my mind.

### Early 2024 – A New Beginning  
I got a powerful gaming laptop, which opened up new possibilities for both gaming and development.

### Mid 2024 – Getting into 3D Modeling  
I developed an interest in 3D modeling and started using Blender to create models, adding another skill to my toolkit.

### Later 2024 – A Passion for Projects  
I installed VSCode and returned to Python, creating projects like RawCF. Now, I'm focused on R23 Engine, my custom game engine.

I’ve come a long way from those early days, and I’m excited to keep learning and creating. If you have any questions about my projects or need advice, feel free to reach out!
